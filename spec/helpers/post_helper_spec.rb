# Specs in this file have access to a helper object that includes

# describe PostHelper do
#   describe "string concat" do
#     it "concats two strings with spaces" do
#       expect(helper.concat_strings("this","that")).to eq("this that")
#     end
#   end
# end
describe PostHelper do
  it "add some tests for emojify"
